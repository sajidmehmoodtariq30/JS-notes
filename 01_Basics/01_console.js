/*
    JS is a scripting language. Can be used for both server side and client side.
    Now I have saved the file as 01.js where 01 is the name of file and js is its extension. Entension describes the type of file which in this case is JavaScript file.
    If we define the file extension then it is understood that text written in that file is not random and each word has a specific meaning. Like if we use .c extension then compiler will check it according to the rules of c.
    Similalrly if we use .js extension compiler or in this case runtime environment will  check it according to the rules of JavaScript.
